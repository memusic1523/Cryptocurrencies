# Cryptocurrencies
  - System: Pandas, Python, Jupyter Notebook, KMeans, PCA, px, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
  
# Overview
Martha pitch an investment in cryptocurrency to her firm Accountability Accounting. We believe that changing the world is what cryptocurrency is all about. However, the recent trends of Bitcoin, it has to cause a price jump that makes it unaffordable for many new investors. We are to help pitch other cryptocurrencies that are available. Martha has the data on cryptocurrencies and can analyze it in any way she wants. We are to help Martha to discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in these new currencies.
 
 # Results  
  - Use input data only
  - Process data for an unsupervised model
  - Use clustering and K-means algorithm
  - Use principle component analysis

We were able to clean up the currencies that have a mined greater than 0. We can see which currency is collecting a return.

As you can see the graph shows the elbow curve at 4 and 5. However, we will be using 4 because it breaks with a vertical direction shifts to a strong horizontal direction.

 # Summary
We were able to help Martha with her pitch to her firm with using unsupervise machine learning. We used clustering and k-mean algorithm inorder to find ouw how many clusters ther will be and how mnay points will belong to each cluster. We also used PCA to speed up machine learning algorithms and filter the features.
